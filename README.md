# Geologic Time Scale
> Builds a geologic timeline SVG image populated with events from Earth's history.

 ### Quick run
 
 1. Clone the repo & run the time.py script.
 ```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jlinick/geologic_time_scale
$ cd geologic_time_scale
$ ./time.py
```
 2. you should now have the timeline.svg in your folder!

<img src="./example.png" width="1200" height="200">

### Notes:

You can change from dark mode to light mode by changing white\_background = True or False in time.py. You can change a bunch of other variables (like how big the image is etc) in the globals in the header.
You can add or remove events or eons/eras/ages/periods in data.py. It's pretty obvious how.

This is coded terribly. It was done quickly & breaks pretty much every good coding standard. I am well aware of this. I don't care.
